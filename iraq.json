The Popular Mobilization Units were heavily involved in the Iraqi Army's offensive to retake Tikrit from IS in March 2015 and have subsequently been active in the Anbar province. However, the Iraq government has announced that the organization will not participate in the anticipated battle to retake Mosul from IS; many sources attribute this decision the sectarian killings of Sunni Iraqis purportedly perpetrated by members of the Popular Mobilization Forces during its previous campaigns in majority Sunni areas. While this umbrella organization has been active in Iraq, there have been no confirmed operations by this group in Syria. ",

The group is based out of Turkish and Iraqi Kurdistan, but has also staged attacks and established training camps in France and Belgium as well as several Middle Eastern countries. Although the group was founded as a Marxist-Leninist organization seeking an independent Kurdish state in Turkish Kurdistan, in the late 1990s it adopted a more libertarian socialist ideology. From 1984 to 2013, the PKK was locked in an armed struggle against Turkey for an independent Kurdish state in Turkish Kurdistan. It also fought alongside the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) against the Kurdish Democratic Party (KDP) in the 1994-1998 Kurdish Civil War. In 2013, the PKK joined the PUK and KDP in the war against the Islamic State (IS). Also in 2013, the PKK signed a ceasefire agreement with the Turkish government; however, the agreement broke down after the PKK allegedly assassinated two Turkish police officers accused of having links to the Islamic State (IS). Shortly after, Turkey joined the war against IS, but in doing so directed the majority of its fire power against PKK camps in Iraqi Kurdistan. The PKK is designated by NATO, the EU, and the United States as a foreign terrorist organization. ",

        "description": "The Kurdish Democratic Party (KDP) is a nationalist, populist Iraqi Kurdish political party that was established in 1946 in Iranian Kurdistan with aid from the Soviet Union. The party is led by Masoud Barzani and ultimately seeks the establishment of an independent Kurdish state. The KDP has historically been the most powerful of the Kurdish nationalist organizations and fought both the Iraqi and Turkish governments in multiple conflicts in the period from 1946-2003. In 1975, Jalal Talabani split from the KDP and founded the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK). Today, the KDP and PUK are the largest and most powerful Kurdish political parties in Iraq. In the first Iraqi Kurdistan elections in 1992, the KDP won 51 seats to the PUK’s 49. However, the two groups have not always cooperated peacefully; from 1994-1998 the PUK and the KDP fought one another in the Kurdish Civil War and only reached a ceasefire with U.S. mediation in 1998. The two parties jointly administered Iraqi Kurdistan from 1998 until 2013. The 2013 elections marked the first time the parties ran as separate entities since 1992. While the KDP won the most seats in the election, the PUK came in third to the Gorran party. The PUK and KDP together can field roughly 75,000 fighters known as peshmerga, which have been engaged fighting the Islamic State (IS) since 2013. In recent years the KDP has been heavily criticized for its corruption and violence against dissidents. In 2016, the KDP announced that Kurdish factions in Baghdad would not participate in the new Iraqi cabinet formed by Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi if the number of ministerial posts given to the the Kurds was not increased. The Kurdish parties are demanding 20% of all government positions but thus far have only received two out of sixteen ministerial positions in the Abadi’s new cabinet.",

However in the 2013 elections, the two groups ran separately and the PUK lost a significant portion of its seats to the Gorran party. Still, however, the PUK and KDP together can field roughly 75,000 fighters known as the peshmerga. Since 2014, the pershmerga have been active fighting the Islamic State in Northern Iraq. Although the PUK has been implicated in the kidnappings of many western nationals in Iraq and was accused of using indiscriminate violence and terror tactics during the Kurdish Civil War, the group has not been designated as a terrorist organization by the U.S., UN, or EU.

The group was based in the city of Khormal and was known for its attacks on bookstores, clubs, beauty salons and tourist areas as well as for targeting women whom the group felt did not dress modestly enough. Kurdish Hamas was initially led by Hassan Sofi and subsequently by Omar Barziani after the IMK assassinated Sofi in 1998. In 1999, Kurdish Hamas merged with the IMK and al-Nahda to form the Islamic Unity Movement of Kurdistan (IUMK). The IUMK only lasted until 2001 at which point Barziani again split from the group with a large number of the IUMK’s more radical Islamist members. He temporarily reformed Kurdish Hamas, only to merge it with Tawheed in July 2001 to form the Tawheed Islamic Front (TIF), which itself eventually merged with several other Kurdish Islamist groups in order to form Ansar al-Islam in late 2001.",

However, unlike Uthman, Sadiq Abdul Aziz maintained close ties between his organization and the Brotherhood throughout the 1990s. Furthermore, he focused al-Nahda on Islamic activism and education rather than on the political and militant activities pursued by Uthman Abdul Aziz and the IMK. In 1999 Sadiq and Ali Abdul Aziz, who succeeded Uthman as the leader of the IMK, merged their two organizations with Omar Barziani’s Kurdish Hamas to form the Islamic Unity Movement of Kurdistan (IUMK). The IUMK union only lasted until 2001, when it fragmented into several splinter groups.

Ali Abdul Aziz subsequently reformed the IMK with the remaining members of the IUMK.",

The group was based in Erbil and fiercely opposed the Kurdish Democratic Party (KDP). Tawhid’s most notable attacks was the assassination of the KDP’s Christian governor of Erbil, Frasno Hariri, in February 2001. Additionally, the group claimed responsibility for a string of smaller attacks in Iraqi Kurdistan in 2000 and 2001 that targeted non-Muslims, foreigners, and women deemed not to be dressed modestly enough. Many Tawhid militants were sheltered by the Islamic Movement of Kurdistan (IMK) in Halabjah when fleeing retaliation from the KDP. In July 2001, Tawhid joined with Kurdish Hamas to form the Tawhid Islamic Front (TIF), which later merged with several other groups to form Ansar al-Islam.",

The formation of Jund al-Islam was encouraged and financially supported by Al Qaeda’s Osama bin Laden. Additionally, at the group’s inception, roughly 60 of Jund al-Islam’s estimated 400 fighters were trained by Al-Qaeda operatives in Afghanistan. In Autumn 2001, Jund al-Islam clashed with the Islamic Movement of Kurdistan (IMK) and eventually wrested the Howraman region of Iraq from its control. Around the same time Jund al-Islam signed a ceasefire agreement with Ali Bapir’s Islamic group, after which the two organizations coordinated with one another. Later in 2001, Jund al-Islam joined with Mullah Krekar’s Reformist group to form Ansar al-Islam.",

IS has its origins in the early 2000s, when Abu Musab al-Zarqawi began training extremist militants. Zarqawi’s militants became a major participant in the Iraqi insurgency during the American occupation, first under the name Jama’at al-Tawhid wa’al-Jihad and then, after swearing fealty to Al Qaeda, as Al Qaeda in Iraq. Facing backlash from the community and increased security from U.S. and Iraqi forces, the group faced decline until 2011, when it began to grow through its involvement in the Syrian Civil War. In 2013, it changed its name to the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS). Over the course of 2013 and 2014, it quickly took over territory in Syria and Iraq. In addition to its rapid expansion, ISIS has also drawn attention for its public beheadings of Western captives and its large contingent of foreign fighters. On the ground, IS has fought Syrian government forces, Syrian rebel groups, the Iraqi military and militias, and the Kurdish peshmerga. The U.S. began airstrikes against the group in fall 2014. ",

The group was purportedly founded in 2013 as a front group for Katai’b Hezbollah (KH) and Asa’ib Ahl al-Haqq (AAH) to route fighters to Syria. However, since that time, the group has begun to operate autonomously from KH and AAH, which have both begun sending fighters to Syria under their own banners. HN is active in Syria, fighting alongside the Syrian Government, Hezbollah, the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and the other predominantly Shiite militias supporting the Assad Regime. The group has also expanded its operations to Iraq, where it is a member of the Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF), under whose auspices it cooperates with other Iraqi Shiite paramilitaries and the Iraqi Government in the fight against the Islamic State. As of November 2016, HN had 10,000 fighters and was conducting the majority of its operations in Aleppo, Syria and Mosul, Iraq. HN is led by Akram al-Kaabi, a former leader in both AAH and the Mahdi Army. The group has close ties to both Hezbollah and Iran, from whom it receives the majority of its funding and resources. ",

        "description": "The Mahdi Army, also known as the Jaysh al-Mahdi (JAM), is a Shiite militia led by Muqtada al-Sadr. The group was founded in 2003 and was considered one of the most dangerous groups in Iraq until early 2008. In March 2008, the Iraqi Security Forces and coalition troops launched a major offensive against the Mahdi Army in Basra, significantly undermining its capacity. After signing a ceasefire agreement with the coalition forces in 2008, Sadr reoriented the Mahdi Army to focus on social services provision for the Shiite community. In 2010, Sadr again redirected the focus of many members of the Mahdi army, this time to the upcoming parliamentary elections, before stepping out of the public eye in 2013. Then in June 2014, he reemerged to revive the Mahdi Army, now called the Peace Brigades, in order to join the fight against the Islamic State.",

KIA was founded in July 2014 by Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, a former commander of the Badr Organizations and of Kata’ib Hezbollah and the current commander of the PMF. However, KIA is currently led by Shabal al-Saidi, who was a former top commander in the Mahdi Army under Muqtada al-Sadr in the early 2000s. The group has also been popularly associated with Abu Azrael, a battle commander famed for wielding a battle axe, sword and machine gun and undertaking dangerous but somewhat comical stunts in the fight against IS. KIA receives significant aid from the Iranian government and works closely with the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) in Iraq. It also cooperates closely with the Iraqi government and the Iraqi Army as well as the other Shiite organizations in the PMF. KIA is also reported to be training a Christian sub-battalion called Kata’ib Rouh Allah Issa Ibn Miriam (The Brigade of the Spirit of God Jesus Son of Mary). The group is also actively fighting in the Syrian Civil War alongside the forces aligned with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. In July 2016, KIA released a statement saying that the bulk of its fighters in Syria would be moving from Aleppo to Palmyra.",

        "description": "The Supreme Council for Islamic Revolution in Iraq (SCIRI), known since 2009 as the Supreme Iraqi Islamic Council (ISCI), is a Shiite political party in Iraq with an active militant wing. ISCI was established by Shiite exiles in Iran, who, in 1982, formed the group with a mission to overthrow Saddam Hussein and install an Iranian-style government. After Saddam Hussein was overthrown, the party quickly tried to establish power in Iraq under the guidance of its new leader, Abdul Aziz al-Hakim. Al-Hakim led the group to increased power through a series of image reforms coupled with pragmatic political decisions to distance the group from its unpopular linkages with Iran and the United States. One of the main ways that al-Hakim distanced the group from Iran was by switching its formal name to the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq (ISCI); however, the group is still commonly referred to as SCIRI. ISIC’s militia is still active, and is by some estimates 10,000 strong. The militia mainly active in the north, where it has in recent years clashed with the British army and Mahdi forces. The group continues, to varying degrees, advocate a separate Shiite-run region in the oil-rich southern Iraq. In 2009, its leader al-Hakim died and was succeeded by his son, Ammar al-Hakim, but doubts remain about\r\nhis ability to effectively lead the group. ",
