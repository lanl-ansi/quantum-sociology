The group was purportedly founded in 2013 as a front group for Katai\u2019b Hezbollah (KH) and Asa\u2019ib Ahl al-Haqq (AAH) to route fighters to Syria. However, since that time, the group has begun to operate autonomously from KH and AAH, which have both begun sending fighters to Syria under their own banners. HN is active in Syria, fighting alongside the Syrian Government, Hezbollah, the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and the other predominantly Shiite militias supporting the Assad Regime. The group has also expanded its operations to Iraq, where it is a member of the Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF), under whose auspices it cooperates with other Iraqi Shiite paramilitaries and the Iraqi Government in the fight against the Islamic State. As of November 2016, HN had 10,000 fighters and was conducting the majority of its operations in Aleppo, Syria and Mosul, Iraq. HN is led by Akram al-Kaabi, a former leader in both AAH and the Mahdi Army. The group has close ties to both Hezbollah and Iran, from whom it receives the majority of its funding and resources.

IS has its origins in the early 2000s, when Abu Musab al-Zarqawi began training extremist militants. Zarqawi\u2019s militants became a major participant in the Iraqi insurgency during the American occupation, first under the name Jama\u2019at al-Tawhid wa\u2019al-Jihad and then, after swearing fealty to Al Qaeda, as Al Qaeda in Iraq. Facing backlash from the community and increased security from U.S. and Iraqi forces, the group faced decline until 2011, when it began to grow through its involvement in the Syrian Civil War. In 2013, it changed its name to the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS). Over the course of 2013 and 2014, it quickly took over territory in Syria and Iraq. In addition to its rapid expansion, ISIS has also drawn attention for its public beheadings of Western captives and its large contingent of foreign fighters. On the ground, IS has fought Syrian government forces, Syrian rebel groups, the Iraqi military and militias, and the Kurdish pesh merga. The U.S. began airstrikes against the group in fall 2014.","dummy":"0","min_zoom":"0","max_zoom":"0","active":true},"Attack":[{"id":"1","description":"JTJ assassinated Laurence Foley in Jordan.","date":"2002-10-28","casualties":"1 killed, 0 wounded","source":"\"Jamaat al-Tawhid wa'l-Jihad,\" GlobalSecurity.org, December 6, 2006, retrieved on January 26, 2010 from http:\/\/www.globalsecurity.org\/military\/world\/para\/zarqawi.htm","group_id":"1"},{"id":"1055","description":"ISIS attacked Baji oil field, although the Iraq Army reported that it successfully drove out ISIS within two to three days of fighting.","date":"2014-06-17","casualties":"Unknown casualties","source":"Rubin, Alissa J. and Suadad Al-Salhy. \u201cIraq Officials Claim Control of Major Refinery in Baji.\u201d The New York Times.

The FSA is not a single cohesive armed opposition group, and the term is often used to refer to a loose alliance of moderate or secular opposition brigades that are fighting against the Assad Regime. In December 2012, the FSA created the Supreme Military Council (SMC, also known as The Council of Thirty) in an attempt to form a command structure among its brigades. The United States announced it would provide $123 million in non-lethal aid to the SMC in April 2013, and Saudi Arabia, The United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Jordan, and Turkey also agreed to give money and weapons to the SMC instead of directly funding individual FSA brigades. However tension arose in the SMC after a group of FSA leaders tried to replace SMC leader General Salim Idriss, and the FSA\u2019s National Coalition for Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces (National Coalition) ordered the SMC to dissolve in June 2014. Since the SMC\u2019s dissolution, it has been unclear if the FSA has an established command structure because the National Coalition has not endorsed any of the institutions proposed to replace the SMC; however, multiple media outlets still cite the FSA as an established group.
